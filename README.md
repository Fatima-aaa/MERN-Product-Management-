This is my initial full stack project, built during my internship at Suave, with the goal of understanding the logic and how things work in a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application.

üöÄ Features

Add new products with name, brand, and price

View all products in a responsive table

Clean dashboard-style UI with form + product list

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB (local instance)

Since this project connects to local MongoDB, it won‚Äôt be fully functional if someone tries to run it without MongoDB installed on their system.
For deployment or easier sharing, the database connection can be switched to MongoDB Atlas (cloud).
